Hello !! Here's a more better intro, so hii! I'm Kinsley. On Ponytown you'll probably see me most either sitting by myself observing the conversations around me, or messing around with my friends probably on vc!! 

More on myself in  general though I'm a yume, or well a riako. Which is a term in the "yumeship" community, you can also say "selfship" riako means that I take my relationship with Edgar Valden seriously! (as in i see myself in a relationship with him) I'm nonsharing. Don't worry I'm not delusional or anything like that, I know he's not real and purely a fictional character !! I just think of him as my lover as I personally don't like the idea of real life relationships and he fills the void and provides the same comfort that a lover would in every way, he makes me more happy than anything on this earth could, I see no wrong in that as he makes my life worth living.

(psst... id giggle and kick my feet like that one anime girl gif if you were to draw edgar on my straw.page)

Anyways I love anything related to snow, its always been my biggest dream to see snow every since I was little so anything winter-ish or just snow in general makes me super super happy! 

I'm a big fan of watching true crime documentaries, the horror genre and drawing!! I also have a huge passion for writing! :]

Games I like are Identity V (Identity V is the game Edgar is from) Genshin (I don't support the developers don't worry! I just like the game) Stardew Valley, Project Sekai, Bandori, Pokémon and Roblox !!

as a reminder though, I'm 18, an adult, so please don't be... weird around me, if you're a minor... thanks
